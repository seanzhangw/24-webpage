                <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
                <p>Our recreation of the Game of 24 recreates the classic arcade experience with a custom interface that
                    blends nostalgic gameplay with a user-experience focused design.</p>
                <p>The Game of 24 is a classic mathematical puzzle where players must use four given numbers and basic
                    arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to form an expression that equals 24. Traditionally the game is
                    played with a deck of cards, where each turn the players will draw four random cards and compete for
                    the fastest speed to calculate to 24. Instead of racing to solve a single round, our implementation
                    tracks the number of collections solved within a configurable time interval.</p>
                <p>The arcade experience is curated with a custom built joystick-based
                    controller, retro-style graphics with the VGA screen, and a persistent leaderboard stored in
                    non-volatile memory. The game is player vs player similar to the
                    versus style arcade games. Difficulty can be adjusted at run-time and a group of 4 numbers of the
                    suitable difficulty are calculated at runtime. Card dealing, flipping animations and sound feedback
                    contribute to the immersive experience.</p>
